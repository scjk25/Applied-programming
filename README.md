# Overview

{Important!  Do not say in this section that this is college assignment.  Talk about what you are trying to accomplish as a software engineer to further your learning.}

## Software Description. 
The software that I created is a basic python script that prints the message "Hello world". The purpose of this project is to demonstrate how to use the print function to write a string. 

## Purpose
The purpose for this software is to show that I understand the basics of using the print function in python to dispaly a message. This software demonstrates the use for strings in python and lays the groundwork for more advanced useses of programming skills and future projects. 


# Development Environment
