## Software Description
- This software uses R to show which airports have the most delays and to show different types of delays such as weather. R is a data science language that you can use to analyze data and create visualizations. In this software you can see different charts that you can visualize to make sense of what the data is showing. 

## Purpose

This information can also be useful for airlines to see which airports have the most delays and to see if they can do anything to help reduce the delays.

## Tools Used
- R
- lets_plot
- ggplot2
- github
