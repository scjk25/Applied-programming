# Sprint 1

## Software Description
This software uses html, javascript and css. For this sprint I learned from a udemy course on how to use html, javascript, and css to create a dice game. The dice game has 2 players that roll a dice and the first player to 100 points wins. If the player rolls a 1 than it sets there current score back to 0. Each player has an option to keep going or hold. If a player decides to hold than it keeps there current score and than swiches to the next player. 

## Purpose
The purpose for this game is to show that I understand the basics of using html, javascript and css. I mainly used javascript to write my 100 lines of code but I used the other languages to pull information from so that I could write my javascript code for the dice game. 

## Tools Used
1. visual studio code 
2. Udemy Javascript course  

## Javascript
For this sprint I used javascript as my main language to learn this week. I leanred that javascript is a powerful programming language that is mostly used for created a web page. Javascript is the most commonly used language to devlop web pages and apps. I also used HTML which is a useful tool alongside javascript to get my information from in order to create my dice game. I also used css to style my web page. Css works with the display of the web page such as font size, color, and images to display.
